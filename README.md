# 🧠 END-TO-END MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE — TITANIC DATASET

## DATASET 📂
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, containing features such as Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, and Embarked.  
Target variable: **Survived** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## KEY STEPS 🛠️

### DATA PREPROCESSING
🧹 Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)  
🔄 Encoded categorical variables (Gender, Embarked)  
📏 Scaled numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler  
🧱 Used `ColumnTransformer` to organize preprocessing

### MODEL PIPELINE
🔗 Built a reusable pipeline using `Pipeline()` from scikit-learn  
🧠 Connected preprocessing and classifier steps

### MODEL TRAINING
🤖 Trained Logistic Regression model  
🧪 Task: Binary Classification (Survived / Not Survived)

### EVALUATION
📊 Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
📉 Optional: Confusion matrix visualized using Seaborn

### MODEL SAVING
💾 Saved the final model using `joblib.dump()`  
⚡ Quickly reload the model with `joblib.load()`

---

## RESULTS 🏅

✅ Clean and modular ML pipeline  
✅ Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression model  
✅ Saved model file: `titanic_model.pkl`

---

## INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 💡

🎯 Use pipeline for other classification problems  
📈 Easily switch classifiers or preprocessors  
🧪 Try hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for better performance
