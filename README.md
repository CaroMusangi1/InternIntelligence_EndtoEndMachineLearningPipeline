🧠 End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline — Titanic Dataset
🚢 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a complete ML pipeline using the Titanic dataset. From data ingestion to model saving, this workflow shows how real-world ML systems are structured and maintained.

🔑 Key Concepts
🔁 Pipeline: Seamlessly connects preprocessing and training steps for modular, clean code.

🧱 ColumnTransformer: Applies specific transformations to specific columns (e.g., scale age, encode gender).

💾 Joblib: Saves your trained model so you can load it later—no need to retrain every time!

⚙️ Workflow Steps
📥 1. Load the Titanic Dataset
The dataset is loaded via pandas.read_csv()

It contains key features: Age, Sex, Pclass, etc.

Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🧹 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values (e.g., age, embarked)

Encode categorical variables like Sex and Embarked

Scale numerical values (e.g., Age, Fare)

All preprocessing is bundled with ColumnTransformer

🔄 3. Build the ML Pipeline
python
Copy
Edit
Pipeline([
  ('preprocessing', ColumnTransformer([...])) ,
  ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])
Makes the entire workflow reusable and clean

Easy to modify or extend (swap out models or steps)

🏋️‍♂️ 4. Train the Model
Model: Logistic Regression

Task: Binary Classification (Survived / Not Survived)

Training on processed features

📊 5. Evaluate Performance
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Optional: Visualize confusion matrix using Seaborn

💾 6. Save the Model
Save your trained pipeline using:

python
Copy
Edit
joblib.dump(pipeline, 'titanic_model.pkl')
Later, you can load it in seconds:

python
Copy
Edit
model = joblib.load('titanic_model.pkl')
🧪 Libraries Used

🚀 How to Use This Project
Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Run all cells from top to bottom.

Customize preprocessing or model settings if needed.

Evaluate results and save the trained model for reuse.

📦 Output
